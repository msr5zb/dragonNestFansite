<h3>Black Dragon</h3>
<br>
Before entering into stage one, you will have to break a pillar. Just use any skills to break it, it does have any skills and is quite easy to kill.<br>
<span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span><font size="4"><span style="color:#ff3300">Stage 1 (Black Smithy Ogre)</span></font><br>
<span style="color:#ff3300"><br>

In this stage, there is a narrow pathway and 6 platforms branching off the side of the pathway. The 6 platforms will initially have lightning on them and you will get damaged and electrocuted if you go on the platforms or get knocked into them. The boss will initially spawn at the top of the pathway with mobs around it.<p class="pic_enlarge" style="position: relative; width: 580px; height: 330px;"><span style="position: absolute; top: 15px; left: 15px;"></span><img class="scrollLoading" href="https://img0.mmo.mmo4arab.com/newforum/upload//2014/07/03/1404379805216.png" src="https://img0.mmo.mmo4arab.com/newforum/upload//2014/07/03/1404379805216.png" height="331" width="580" style=""></p> <br>
<b><u><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000">Basic Boss Skills</span></font></u></b><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Frontal Slam:</span> The boss will swing his club forwards, can be dodge by a tumble or just staying to the side or back. You will receive a slow debuff and bone crush debuff if you are hit. The bone crush buff deals 150k damage per hit. The status can be cured so priests and bringers always be ready to cure when needed to avoid any accidental deaths. <span style="color:#ff3300">(Skill shown at 0:45 and 1:10 for clearer demonstration) </span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Charge:</span> The boss's body will glow red and black and shake before charging forward in a straight line. High damage if you get hit so try to stay to the side and back when dpsing. <span style="color:#ff3300">(Skill shown at 0:56)</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Frontal Nudge:</span> The boss will tilt his head back, very similar to frontal slam but he will nudge the player in front of him instead of swinging with his club. After that, he will jump and slam the player with the agro. The nudge can be avoided by staying to the sides, the slam can be avoided by just a tumble or moving away from his landing location. <span style="color:#ff3300">(Skill shown at 0:49)</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Bomb throw:</span> The boss will throw a red bomb onto the map and anyone near it will get sucked towards it. It has a chance to trigger electrocution if you are hit and will explode after 5-6 seconds. Very similar to raven's level 50 crow trap skill except the suction is really weak. You will receive a bone crush debuff if you are hit by the explosion.<span style="color:#ff3300"> (Skill shown at 1:02, 5:28 to see close up explosion of the skill)</span><br>
<br>
When the boss's hp reaches 3x for the first time, he will activate the stage mechanic. <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Mechanic: </span>4 gates will drop down separating party members if they are spread out. Then one of the 6 platforms will glow blue, this is the safe platform and all party members will have 10 seconds to reach the safe platform before the boss charges forward and kills you.The gate can be ice stacked and debuffed by anything, including weapon debuffs ( like Int weapons), other skills such as sword masters luring slice etc.<br>
Additionally, when the mechanic is triggered, it will also remove all buffs and kill any and all summons. Best idea is for assassins to use raid again so everyone can get that bonus %10 damage or for priests to quickly use blessing of strikes to help in breaking the walls<br>
<br>
It is recommended party members gather at the centre of the stage and look for the safe platform from there. Make sure you don't stage at the spot where the gates drop down or you will take damage and be potentially knocked out of the middle.<br>
Another important thing to note is, once the boss charges, you will die if you step down during the charge or before the yellow waves behind him have gone past you. Once everything is clear, step back into the pathway or you will be hit by the lightning that will respawn on the platform.<span style="color:#ff3300"> (1:49 for what happens if you leave the platform too late)</span><br>
<br>
This mechanic will be repeated every 60 seconds after 3x hp bar.<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000">New skill at 3x hp</span></font></u></b><br>
<span style="color:#660000"></span><br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Front swipe 3x:</span> This is the same skill from the bishop ogre looking boss in guardian nest. The boss will swipe forwards 3 times follow by a final hit that will knock you into the air. If you are hit, there will be a bone crush and slow debuff and without power tumble or aerial evasion, you will likely take the full hit. Stay to the side or back of the boss to dps safely and avoid this. <span style="color:#ff3300">(Shown at 2:13)</span><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300"><br>

<b><u><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000">New skill at 2x hp </span></font></u></b><br>
<span style="color:#660000"></span><br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Stomp:</span> This boss's stomp is very similar to the spirit dancer's level 50 skill Praetor. The boss will slam the ground in front of him twice initially. This will only damage anyone in front of him and you do not need to jump to avoid this, just stay to the side or back. After the initial 2 hits, the boss will raise both his hands to slam the ground. Jump to avoid the slam, it is full map and can't be blocked or iframed. If hit you will have a slow debuff. <span style="color:#ff3300">(3:39 for demonstration)</span><br>
<span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span><br>
<b><u><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000">New skill at 1x hp </span></font></u></b><br>
<b><u><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"><br>
</span></font></u></b><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Frontal beam: </span></font><font size="2">Skill is very similar to adept's level 50 ice beam skill. The boss will charge up then shoot a black lazer beam in front of him. The range is quite long, damage is high and you will be silenced for 5 sec if you are hit. <span style="color:#ff3300">(4:49 for demonstration)</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300"><br>

<font size="4">Stage 2 (Belin)</font></span><br>
<font size="4"><span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6YeaT5uS-A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><font size="4"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">At the start of this stage, you will make your way through 2 rooms to reach the Fire Minotaur boss. To reach the next room you have kill the statue which is initially invincible. In each of the 2 rooms, the goal is to clear mobs and keep Belin alive. You do not need to clear all the mobs but they will prevent you from giving Belin hp (in the case Belin dies) if they hit you. </font><font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">The main mob you must kill in these rooms are these "summoned bodies" <span style="color:#ff3300">(0:54 for reference)</span>. They will explode after a certain amount of time if you fail to kill them and they will automatically start attacking Belin so kill asap. </font>If you fail to kill all the bodies before time runs out, they will deal exactly 50% of your max hp to you. <font size="2">After the summoned bodies are destroyed, you must check if Belin is alive, if he is, you will be able to attack the statue in front of Belin for a few seconds before it becomes invincible again.</font><span style="color:#ff3300">(1:07 for reference)</span>.<font size="2"> </font>To revive Belin, you have to click on the robot thing near him and let him suck 200k per tick from you.<br>
<br>
Room 1 will have 1 summoned body and room 2 will have 4 summoned bodies that appear in each corner of the room. Also the first statue has about 50% less hp than the second statue you have to kill, so don't overkill on the first statue. Ice stacking works on the statues.<br>
After making past the 2 rooms, you will enter a circular arena to fight the Fire Minotaur. <br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><span style="color:#ff3300">Stage 3 (Fire Minotaur)</span></font><br>

<br>
There will be lava around the outer edge of the map, avoid going into the lava or you will take damage and receive a burn debuff, roughly 70k hp a tick.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"><b><u>Basic Boss Skills</u></b></span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"></span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Frontal Charge:</span> The boss will slam his axe down on the ground in front of him and charge forward, stay to the side to avoid. Clears all buffs if you are hit. <span style="color:#ff3300">(0:48 for reference)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Frontal Swing:</span><span style="color:#ff3300"> </span>The boss will do a small jump and then slam his axe in front of him then towards his back, follow by a frontal swing. This skill will reverse your keyboard if you are hit, very high damage and dangerous and this is the main reason why dpsing at the back of the boss is very dangerous. Stick to the side to avoid this. <span style="color:#ff3300">(0:55 for reference)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Axe Throw:</span><span style="color:#ff3300"> </span>The boss will throw fire axes at every party member. The landing spot of the axe will have an orange circle on it. Walk in a straight line or a circle to avoid. If you are hit you will be burned, the burn debuff hurts so try to dodge this skill.<span style="color:#ff3300"> (1:02 for reference)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Fluffalo Charge:</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300"> </span></font><font size="2">The good old 24 cap Minotaur Nest skill. The boss will roar and a yellow text on the screen will say the minotaurs are charging in. Look on the minimap or around you to see which direction the minotaurs are charging into the arena. Getting hit by the minotaurs will not cause much damage but it will induce a burn debuff which hurts. </font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">(1:09, 2:08 for reference)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Stomp:</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300"> </span></font><font size="2">Red magma waves will glow around the boss and then move away in a straight line. Avoid getting hit by these by standing in between two magma waves. If you are hit, you will be knocked into the air and receive a burn debuff. After the magma waves radiate out from the boss, he will lift his leg and stomp. Failing to jump the stomp will cause party members to receive huge damage and also a slow debuff.</font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300"> (1:57, 4.34 for reference)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Stage Mechanic: </span></font><font size="2">At the end of each hp bar, the boss will disappear and reappear in the middle. All party members must then go to their assigned bubble and hit it to receive a invincibility buff. Failing to do so will cause you to die unless you have a lot of hp and defense. The bubbles spawn according to the yellow circles on the map. You may hit the bubble as soon as you reach them since the buff is 5 seconds and party members have 5 seconds to reach their own bubble. </font><br>

<br>
Numbers 12, 6 9 and 3 are always at the small yellow circles on the ground. Usually give them to people who aren't very experienced. The more experinced people take the other spots. Avoid using aoe skills like Raven's umbra and consecration towards the end of each hp bar.</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">After the boss casts this mechanic at the end of 2x and 1x hp bar, he will pull all the party member to the centre and reduce the area of the battlefield, the boss will be invincible during this part and there will be a yellow text notifying party members that the area of the battlefield is reducing. Refer to the stage layout to see the amount of area reduction. This will mean there is less room to dodge the boss skills and the area that the lava covers will increase as the fight goes on.</font><br>

<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Confusion:</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"> </span></font><font size="2">The boss will disappear and reappear in the middle like the stage mechanic. As soon as you see the boss disappear, make your way quickly to the centre of the map. When the boss reappears, everyone will receive a 4 second debuff that causes you to run outwards into the lava. You must adad as fast as you can to break out. This debuff can't be cured or brush offed. </font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">(3:10 for reference)</span></font><br>

<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">180 Degree Swing: </span></font><font size="2">The boss will charge up and do a 180 degree swing in front of him. Exactly the same as every other minotaur boss that uses this skill. The aoe of the swing will have orange lines on it. To avoid just go to the side of the boss or the back. The swing can't be blocked or iframed, heavy damage.</font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Berserk: </span></font><font size="2">The boss will roar and buff up. Berserk status is noted by a yellow icon on the head of the boss. Mercenary can debuff the berserk status with enervating howl. During berserk mode, the boss will 2 hit any party member so avoid getting hit at all cost.</font><br>

<font size="4"><span style="color:#ff3300">Stage 4 (Punisher) </span></font><span style="color:#ff3300">Phase 1</span><br>
<br>
<br>
In phase 1, you will enter an area with a cannon in the middle and the punisher boss being invincible. The only way you can damage the punisher is through shooting it with the cannon. After successfully shooting the punisher 3 times, you will be able to move to phase 2 through the door. If you don't go through the door, the punisher boss will explode and kill you.<br>
<br>
In order to shoot the punisher, party members must destroy the 4 energy orbs that spawn at the 4 corners of the map. The ball's hp is not very high so assign a dps to each orb. Failing to destroy all 4 balls within 10 seconds will cause them to explode and everyone in the party will receive a no heal debuff. If all 4 orbs are destroyed successfully, the cannon will fire a lazor beam and the person with the agro must lure the punisher in front of the cannon. If the cannon does not hit the punisher, you must repeat this process all over again until you hit the boss 3 times with the cannon.<br>
<br>
It is recommended the person with agro, normally the ice witch or mercenary, keep the boss in front of the cannon at all times to prevent failing to shoot the boss.<br>

<b><u>Basic Boss Skills</u></b><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Frontal Swing:</span>The boss will tilt back slightly then swing forwards with his axe twice. The frontal aoe is huge so do not stand in front of him and if you are in front, make sure you are really far away.

<span style="color:#6600cc"><br>
</span><br>

<span style="color:#6600cc"><br>
</span><br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Black Tornado: </span>The boss will cast this every time you successfully hit the boss with the cannon. So after hitting the boss, run away as far as possible and keep running away until the skill is over. The suction is strong and aoe is larger than you might think.<span style="color:#6600cc"> </span><span style="color:#ff3300">(0:34 for reference)</span><br>

<span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span><br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Party Debuff: </span>The boss will shake its head and there will be some sort of black aura around his mouth and he will knock all the party members to the ground. This skill will destroy all superarmour and cause a map wide party debuff. The attack kills all summons. It does no damage and can't be avoided.<span style="color:#ff3300"> (2:16 for reference)</span><br>
<span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span><br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Stage Mechanic:</span> At the end of each boss's hp bar, he will bind all party members with a 9 second debuff which you must adad as fast as you can to get out. A portal will be opened in the middle of the map which allows party members to travel back to the phase 1 battlefield. The portal will disappear within 8 seconds after the boss binds everyone in the party. <br>
<br>
Players must divide the dps evenly beforehand for this mechanic. Half of the dps will go through the portal to the phase 1 battlefield. These party members may stay anywhere at the end of the boss's hp bar, as long as they make it through the portal. However, the party members that are not going through the portal must avoid being at the centre of the map at the end of the hp bar, or you will be automatically teleported to the phase 1 battlefield.<br>
<br>
Once players have split up, 2 clones of the punisher boss will spawn. The clones have exactly the same basic attacks as the real boss and will usually stomp after spawning. Party members in the phase 1 and 2 area must then kill both punishers within 5 seconds of each other. However, you must not dps the boss too fast because once one punisher dies, the other will become significantly harder to kill. Failing to kill both punishers within 5 seconds or a certain period of time will cause a party wipe.<br>
<br>
After the players in the phase 1 area have killed the punisher, make your way back to phase 2 by going through the portal. <span style="color:#ff3300">(3:20 for reference)</span><br>

</span></font></u></b><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Tracing Explosion: </span></font><font size="2">This skill is very similar and almost identical to the Party Debuff skill. The way you differentiate this skill from the Party Debuff is whether or not you took damage after being knocked down, or by looking at the boss. The boss will raise his weapon and slam the ground. If you do not jump you will receive damage and be knocked down. After being knocked down, the boss will summon black auras that follows party members. You can't avoid the black aura and once you are hit with it, a purple circle will spawn below you causing high damage. To avoid this skill, all the party members must gather right next to the boss after being knocked down. Then back off immediately after the black aura hits you and the purple circles spawn. </font><font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">You can iframe the knockback by dodging right as he stabs his sword into the ground ( exactly what i did with my LF in the video). Another approach is to have the team mates stand away and have someone who can summon something ( such as a mystic summoning her mirror, or a priest summoning his relic or a Gear master shooting her duck) and placing that summoned object directly infront of him ( like right on the same spot his sword was stabbed into). The tracing purple spots will get obstructed by that summon and be unable to reach the team mates.</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">Avoid dpsing the boss during this time until the purple circles are gone to be safe. </font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">(6:18 for reference)</span></font><br>

This boss's design is almost identical to desert dragon's golem. It is a dps race boss and the whole party will be wiped if you do not kill the boss within 8 ice balls (will be explained later Ball of Doom skill). Certain golem attacks will induce a no heal debuff, I will outline them in the boss attack descriptions. This debuff will also greatly reduce your damage, around -40% I think.<br>

<b><u>Basic Boss Skills</u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Frost Chaos: </span></font><font size="2">The boss will throw a snowball from one of his hand at the player with agro. A blue circle will appear where the snowball will land. Players must move away from the blue circle or they will be frozen for 10 seconds and receive high damage. Next, 4 ice spikes will move outwards in 4 different directions from the snowball. Watch where the spikes are going and avoid them, or you will be frozen for 10 seconds and the damage is quite high. <span style="color:#ff3300">(9:52 for reference)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Swipe:</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"> </span></font><font size="2">The boss will do an aoe swipe with his hand like every other golem boss. Just tumble to dodge. </font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">(9:17 for reference)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Stomp: </span></font><font size="2">The boss will raise both his hands into the air and slam the ground. This skill does a lot of damage and will induce the no healing if you are hit. The animation is also very fast so can be hard to avoid.</font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"> </span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">(9:09 for reference)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Machine Arm: </span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000">The boss will extend one of his arms forwards and cause anyone in its path to be continuously hit. Pretty low damage and easy to dodge. The boss will use this as the first skill almost all the time. </span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">(9:06 for reference)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Chilling Mist:</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"> The boss will shoot ice in front of his face like the elestra's chilling mist skill. Almost impossible to dodge if you are not next to the boss and have no iframes. Damage is quite high and causes a slow debuff.</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Suction: </span></font><font size="2">The boss will raise his arms and throw them around, similar to Desert Dragon Nest's bishop missile drop attack. Players will be sucked towards the middle where there will be a cyclone that freezes anyone it hits. The damage is very high if you get hit, however the suction is also very weak and can be easily dodged.</font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"> </span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">(9:23 for reference)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Ball of Doom:</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"> </span></font><font size="2">The boss will spread his arms wide open and blow all party members back. This skill will destroy all party member's superarmour and you can't prevent being blown back. All buffs will be cleaned. One of the eight party members must then touch a ball that spawns in the middle of the map. The ball will move towards the boss and if it is not touched before it hits the boss, the whole party will be wiped. The same player also can't touch the ball twice in a row or he will die. Therefore, the whole party has to kill the boss after the 8th party member has touched the ball or the whole party will eventually be wiped.</font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"> </span></font><span style="color:#ff3300">(9:34 for reference)</span><br>

<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Stage Mechanic:</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"> </span></font><font size="2">At the end of each hp bar, the boss will pull all party members to the right or left side of the map. Everyone will receive a 6 second freeze debuff which you must adad out of. After adading out, you must proceed to break 2 walls of ice to reach the other side. </font>While you are doing this, the boss is sweeping the whole field with an ice beam, so failing to break the walls in time or adading too slow will get you killed. <br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="2">The freeze condition cannot be cured ( i've tried countless times with LF's cure trying to save my team mates who were still frozen) so you must adadad as fast as you can or gg. Also just like stage 1's walls, the ice walls can be debuffed by anything ( int weps or other debuffs like Light Furies Sunshine spark).</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
After reaching the other side, this is the best time to dps the boss! Some teams are able to dps a whole bar of the boss during this mechanic which makes the boss fight really easy. <span style="color:#ff3300">(10:16 for reference)</span><br>

After entering the stage, the dragon will immediately attack you with tracing bombs. Walk around to avoid. If you are hit, you will receive a no heal debuff. <span style="color:#ff3300">(0:11 for reference)</span><br>

For phase 1, basically you need to drag the minions to the dragons breath and disable them with any skills that can disable them such as freezing ( this is usually one of the main roles of the elestra/Sally in the party). The dps will only dps to about 0.3x of each hp bar. If you push to 0.25x of each bar, it will cause the dragon to move to another side of the map and summon more minions. If you do not disable and kill all the minions before dragon enters phase 2, immediate party wipe. <br>
<br>
These mobs are invincible and usually tanks will be assigned to luring.&nbsp;&nbsp;The players luring must lure the mobs to face the mouth of the dragon, the dragon breath will extend the whole way to the bottom edge of the map and it is recommended that the people luring stay at the bottom end since you will avoid all of dragon's attacks except the tracing explosions. Ice witches can freeze the mobs while raven's umbra can help slow the mobs down. Once the dragon casts his dragon breath, get out of the aoe of the breath asap. <br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Wave 4 17.25x Dragon hp:</span> Punishers, the most annoying mobs to lure. They can cast a cyclone spin so it is recommended you freeze these asap when they get into the aoe of the dragon breath. <span style="color:#ff3300">(3:40 for reference)</span><br>
<span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span><br>
<span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span>Dragon will summon minions every 0.25x of an hp bar ( so he starts with pallies at the start then at 20.25x he summons abn assasins. At 19.25x he summons ice mages and at 18.25x he summons punshers). Do not dps past the 0.25x mark of each hp bar until each wave of monsters has been killed by the dragons breath to keep the party organized and avoid any accidental deaths. Punishers are extermely important to disable. They hit extremely hard and can induce a burn that deals 175k per tick. Very important for an elestra or another disabler to deal with them asap! Dragon phase 2 starts roughly at 16.5x.<br>
<br>
The only attack you will have to worry about while next to the dragon is claw swipe, nothing else will hit you. To dodge claw swipe use any iframe skills or tumble.<span style="color:#ff3300"> (1:00 for reference to what claw swipe looks like)</span> Dpsers must also take note to not stand really close to the dragon's claws, since you might be stuck under the dragon as the dragon changes location after each wave of mobs. After dpsing the dragon to 19x, 18x and 17x hp, he will teleport to a new location on the map and you must repeat the luring mob process again.<br>

<font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"><b><u>Dragon's Attacks</u></b></span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"></span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Claw Swipe:</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"> </span></font><font size="2">Dragon's claws will glow red and swipe at party members. Tumble or iframe to dodge. </font><span style="color:#ff3300">(6:36 for reference) I</span><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000">f you iframe right when you see his hand glow bright ( or hear a sharp "clink" type of sound), you'll evade getting hit completely ( and that's what i kept doing with my ele in the vid).</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"><br>
</span></font><br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Push or Pull: </span><br>
Another tricky skill to get used to. The dragon will spawn two circle of fire. A small inner circle in the middle of the map and a big large outer circle at the edge of the map. Players have 2-3 seconds to coordinate themselves before they are either pushed to the edge of the map or pulled towards the middle of the map. The push and pull effect of this skill is really strong so be prepared, spirit boost will definitely help.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
To tell which direction to go, look at the direction the dust clouds are moving. If they are moving outwards, you run towards the centre. If they are moving inwards, you move away from the centre.<br>
<br>
If you look again at the video at 17:50 for example, you can see that the dust clouds are moving away from the centre of the circle. So that means we must move inwards. <span style="color:#ff3300">(17:50 for reference)</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Suction Tracing Explosion: </span></font><font size="2">One of the hardest skills to dodge at dragon. The area in front of the dragon will glow red. A tornado will appear in front of the dragon's mouth. Refer to the follow image to whether or not you will be pulled towards the tornado. While this suction effect is happening, the same tracing explosion from phase 1 of dragon fight will occur. Players will receive a no healing debuff for 40 seconds if they are hit. This mechanic can get very messy if all the party members are pulled towards the tornado, since there is very limited room to dodge the explosions. For party members that are not pulled in, make your way back to the dragon's front claws asap after the attack to avoid getting side breathed or tail swiped. </font><span style="color:#ff3300">(5:45 for reference)</span><br>

</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Dive/Stomp: </span></font><font size="2">The dragon will fly up into the air and will either dive or stomp. The amount of times it dives is totally random but after stomping the dragon will land. To differentiate between dive and stomp, watch the dragon as it flies into the air. If the dragon flies backwards, its a dive, if the dragon flies directly upwards, it is a stomp. </font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">Best way to avoid the stomp is to jump the moment you see the axe at the end of his tail disappear from your screen. That way you won't get hit.<br>
<br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">Possible combinations of attacks:</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">1. Stomp and land</font><br>
<font size="2">2. Dive, dive and land</font><br>

</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Confusion:</span></font><font size="2"> </font><font size="2">A yellow message will appear telling party members that the confusion status will be applied. Party members must make their way into the middle of the map asap and adad out of the 8 second confusion status. Failing to adad out will result in your character walking into the orange outer circle during this skill and you will take damage. The damage taken is however not very high. </font><font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">(5:23 for reference)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Inner suction:</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"> </span></font><font size="2">The dragon will disappear and pull all party members into the middle of the map. Your keys will be reversed and you must get up asap and make your way to an assigned position on the map, usually 3 oclock. It is recommended you save your aerial evasion or wake up attack for this skill or you might not make it or cause party wipes. As you are pulled towards the circle, circles of fire will gradually extend out until the very edge of the map, if you are hit by these, you will be knocked outwards towards the edge of the map and take damage. </font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">Once the circle of fires have stopped, a black circle will appear beneath each party member and the dragon will launch missiles into the aoe. Therefore it is vital that all party members gather together at one location. Party members can now either make their way clockwise or anticlockwise around the outer perimeter of the map while avoiding the black circle aoe. Take note that you do not have to move together nor does it matter how many party members are moving clockwise or anticlockwise as long as you don't run too fast. To avoid getting hit, all you need to do is step slightly outside of the black aoe, no need to go too far.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2">The black circles left on the ground deal damage as well as induce a no heal debuff if you step over hit. So that's why it's very important to keep the team organized because if one person screws up, it can cause people to accidentally die and cause the run to collapse.</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
After the last circle. Pay attention for the quick flash on your screen. The moment you see it, jump! Dragon will always do that flash right before he stomps so use it as an indication for when to jump. </font><span style="color:#ff3300">(5:56 for reference)</span><br>

<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Side Breath:</span></font><font size="2"><span style="color:#660000"> </span></font><font size="2">The dragon will tilt its head and cast a massive side breath.

</font><br>
<font size="2">Phase 3 begins at 9:17 of the video. In this phase, a similar mechanic to Desert Dragon's Manticore and Scorpion occurs. There will be 3 main "boss" mobs and 3 random mobs that spawn during this phase. </font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Boss Mobs are the following:</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">1. Bishop:</span> This is the "bomb", and will explode immediately after the punisher is killed. This mob will also make every mob around it invincible.</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">2. Punisher:</span> This is the "bomb switch". Killing this mob triggers the Bishop to explode immediately.</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
<span style="color:#ff3300">3. Paladin:</span> This is the "safety buff". Killing this mob produces an blue aoe which provides party members with a buff that prevents them from being damaged by the bishop's explosion. This mob will continuously respawn if killed as long as you do not kill the punisher.</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#6600cc">Random Mobs are the following:</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">1. Ice mage:</span> Kill on sight. These mobs make this stage 10 times more annoying. They will drain your mana and most importantly cause a map wide 10second freeze debuff on every party member if they are not killed. <span style="color:#ff3300">(13:23 for reference to this aoe freeze debuff)</span></font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">2. Shadow bombers:</span> Avoid killing these, but if you do kill them nothing happens. These are probably the best random mob you can get since there are really no negative effects to killing them or leaving them alive. They will however plant bombs around them that will destroy your superarmour if you come too close.</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2"><span style="color:#ff3300">3. Dragon Cultists:</span> Do not ever kill these mobs! These dragon cultists will explode immediately after being killed and will cause 50% max hp dmg to all party members and also induce a no healing debuff for40sec. Leave them alone!!!</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>

<font size="2">The way to do this stage is one person will initially lure the Bishop away. In the video demonstration it was the light fury. After the Bishop has spawned, the Punisher will spawn about 5 seconds after. Someone else lure the Punisher away, preferably a dps class. Dps the Punisher down to about 0.4x hp and do not kill him. Now you wait for the Paladin to spawn. While you are waiting for the Paladin to spawn, random mobs will start spawning one by one around the map. Rest of the team must find the ice mages and kill them asap. After the Paladin spawns, a third person or the same dps luring the Punisher can lure the Paladin away. Kill the Punisher FIRST before killing the Paladin. If the Paladin dies before the Punisher, do not kill the Punisher or you will party wipe. It is only safe to kill the Paladin AFTER the Punisher has died. <span style="color:#ff3300">(10:24 for reference to how to complete this)</span></font><br>

<span style="color:#6600cc">Mark of Death:</span><span style="color:#ff3300"> </span>One party member will be randomly marked by the dragon. This party member will have an aoe around them that will damage any party member inside of the aoe. The marked person must then quickly make their way to the hind leg of the dragon and wait for the aoe to disappear from them. After the aoe disappears, it will create a bigger aoe circle in the player's location. Therefore the player must quickly make their way back to the front claws of the dragon to avoid getting side breathed or killed by the aoe. The dragon will not attack party members during this skill and it is the best time to dps the dragon in phase 4. <span style="color:#ff3300">(16:12 for reference, 17:40 for demonstration of me killing people :D)</span><br>

</span><br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Gravity Crush:</span><span style="color:#ff3300"> </span>Random circles of aoe will appear on the floor, move out of the asap to avoid getting hit. <span style="color:#ff3300">(18:12 for reference)</span><br>
<span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span><br>
<span style="color:#6600cc">Rotating Dragon Breath:</span><span style="color:#ff3300"> </span>Almost always starts at 6.25x and becomes the highest priority skill for him. For this rotating breath, the dragon will suck all the party member to the centre of the map.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stairs to the pillars above will be located at 2, 5, 7 and 11 oclock on the map. Players must all make their way to the 11 oclock stairs on the map since this is the only location that guarantees you will never die to dragon breath. After making their way to the top of the stairs, players must wait for the dragon to start its dragon breath before moving to the first platform, otherwise you might jump into dragon breath in front of you. <span style="color:#ff3300">(18:34, dragon breath starts on the platform in front of us) </span><br>

After dragon starts to shoot his breath, you can only stay on a pedestal for about 4 seconds before it breaks. Keep in mind while jumping that each stone is at different heights so be careful when jumping to not overshoot it lol.<br>
<br>
Tab your weapons and jump from one pillar to the next. Do not jump too fast or other party members might not catch jump. However do not go too slow just to make up for some slow jumpers because going to slow will cause you to die to dragon breath almost every time. Pillars will start to shake and fall after a few seconds after they are jumped on. If you for whatever reason can't make it to the 11 oclock stairs, then please don't go up any of the other stairs and cause a party wipe...<span style="color:#ff3300">(18:25 for reference)</span><br>

<font size="4"><span style="color:#ff3300">General Advices At Dragon</span></font><br>
<font size="4"><span style="color:#ff3300"><br>
</span></font><br>
<font size="2">1. Dps at the front claws of the dragon like Desert Dragon Nest. I like to stay to the side of the claws but this requires you to tumble to dodge the side breath aoe. The reason I like staying to the side is you will not be pulled in towards the tornado by the dragon's Suction Tracing Explosion skill. And without the pulling effect, dodging the tracing explosion is pretty standard.</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">2. After every skill, whether is it the adad from Confusion, Dragon Dive/Stomp, Inner Suction, etc, ALWAYS make your way back to the front claw of the dragon. You do not want to eat a side breath...</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">3. If you are marked by the Mark of Death skill, move towards the hind claw of the dragon. But also take note of what utility skills you have since you want to make your way back to the dragon's front claw asap after this skills. Light fury's tunnel skill will greatly assist party members in making their way back. Slow classes like cleric may end up eating a side breath unfortunately... It seems like dragon will almost always follow up this skill by a side breath so make your way back quickly, or stay at the tail temporarily.</font><br>
<font size="2"><br>
</font><br>
<font size="2">4. Avoid using wax, spirit boost or any other action movement speed buff in assisting party members to move to the centre during dragon's Confusion skill. While it may help you move to the centre faster, you will also have to adad faster since your character will be running outwards faster too。<br>
